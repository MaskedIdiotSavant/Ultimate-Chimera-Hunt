Ultimate Chimera Hunt
======

Ultimate Chimera Hunt is a fast paced, casual game based on the RPG known as "Mother 3." The game has a series of rounds where the pigmasks battle the Ultimate Chimera. 

As a Pigmask: Do your duty to King Porky and turn off the Chimera by pressing the button on its back without being bit! If you successfully do so, you will be awarded one rank advancement. 

As the Chimera: Your sole purpose is to destroy anything in your path! The pigmask army has come to stop you, but you're not going down without a fight, right?
